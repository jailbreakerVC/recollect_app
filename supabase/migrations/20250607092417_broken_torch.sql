/*
  # Simple RLS Policy for Bookmark Manager

  1. Security Setup
    - Re-enable RLS on bookmarks table
    - Create simple, effective policies for Google OAuth users
    - Use user_id directly for authorization

  2. Policies
    - Users can only access bookmarks where user_id matches their Google ID
    - All CRUD operations are allowed for own bookmarks
    - No complex functions or context switching needed
